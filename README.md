SPECIFICTION....

Step 1: Shopping cart
* You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and 
oranges.   
* Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p. 
* Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs 
the total cost 
* For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05 
* Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many 
candidates take a list of strings as input 
 
Step 2: Simple offers
* The shop decides to introduce two new offers 
	* buy one, get one free on Apples 
	* 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges 
* Update your checkout functions accordingly
